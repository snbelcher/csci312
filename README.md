coding projects from CSCI 312


derive.py uses the Binary.txt(given by the professor) to generate a grammer file. If I remember correctly, I was unable to get this working properly

dt.pas is a pascal file that works with dates, including leap years.

box, cone, point, shape, sphere and main.cpp and their accompanying .h files, along with the test file objs.txt, are C++ files that create shape a shape class and then create derived classes from that initial class. Skeleton code for shape.h and shape.cpp, as well as box.cpp and box.h were provided by the professor. 

lists.hs is a Haskell file where we apply list operations to produce a specific output. This was a project more intended to just familiarize us with Haskell.
